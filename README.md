# Flight Delays and Cancellations (Tableau)

This project analyzes **U.S. flight performance in 2015** using Tableau.  
The goal is to explore where delays happen, what causes them, and how they vary across airlines, months, and states.  
The results are presented through one dashboard and two supporting worksheets.

## Dashboard

### Airline Performance and Delay Causes
![Airline Performance](docs/images/airline_performance.png)  
[View Interactive Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/FlightDelaysandCancellations_17550072797200/Dashboard1)

This dashboard provides an overview of U.S. airline performance in 2015, focusing on total flights, average delay minutes, and the percentage of delayed flights.  
Airlines are ranked by total delay minutes, highlighting those with the most significant performance issues.  
It also breaks down the main causes of delays—such as air system, late aircraft, and weather—showing which factors impact each airline the most.

## Worksheets

### 1. Delay Minutes by State (2015)

This visualization shows the geographic distribution of flight delay minutes across U.S. states in 2015.  
Texas, California, and Florida recorded the highest delays, reflecting their role as major flight hubs.  
States with lighter colors indicate fewer delays and less overall impact.

### 2. Delay by Month (2015)

This line chart tracks flight delays month by month in 2015, revealing clear seasonal patterns.  
Delays peaked in July, likely due to increased summer travel, while the lowest delays occurred in May.  
These insights highlight high-traffic periods where additional operational resources may be needed.

## Key Learnings
- How to extract meaningful insights from large transportation datasets  
- Identifying seasonal patterns and geographic hotspots in flight delays  
- Presenting data in a way that supports operational planning and decision-making  

## Files
- **Flights.pdf** – Documentation of the analysis  
- **Flights Delay by State.twbx** – Packaged Tableau workbook  
- Tableau Public links – Interactive dashboards available online  

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Tableau can transform raw flight data into actionable insights.  
By combining one dashboard and two worksheets, it highlights airline performance, seasonal trends, and regional challenges that affect millions of passengers each year.
